    <div class="scope">
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
      <p>Web developers are building sophisticated applications where application performance is a critical feature. Web developers need the ability to observe the performance characteristics of their applications, and they need the ability to write more efficient applications, using well-defined interoperable methods.</p>

      <p>The Web Performance Working Group's deliverables include user agent features and APIs to observe and improve aspects of application performance. These deliverables will apply to desktop and mobile browsers and other non-browser environments where appropriate and will be consistent with Web technologies designed in other working groups including HTML, CSS, WebApps, DAP and SVG.</p>

      <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
      <p>In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is expected to have two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Out of Scope</h3>
      <p>The following items are not in scope:</p>

        </li>
        <li>performance data analysis techniques or algorithms.

    <div class="participation">
      <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
      <p>To be successful, the Web Performance Working Group is expected to have 5 or more active participants for its duration. The Chairs and specification Editors are expected to contribute one day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>

      <p>The Web Performance Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for building Test Suites for each specification. </p>

      <p>The group encourages questions and comments on its public mailing lists, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>

      <p>The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="communication">
      <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
      <p>Most Web Performance Working Group Teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. Note the <a href="#decisions">Decision Policy</a> below with regards to synchronous meetings.</p>

      <p>This group primarily conducts its work in <a href='http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/board/'>github issues</a> and on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:public-web-perf@w3.org" id="public-web-perf">public-web-perf@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-perf/">archive</a>). The public is invited to contribute to the github repositories and post messages to the list. Regular activity summaries around the github repositories will be provided.</p>

      <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the Web Performance Working Group home page.</p>

      <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>

      <p>Information about the group (for example, details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants) will be available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web Performance Working Group home page</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>
      <p>
        As explained in the W3C Process Document (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
        3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
        consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
        editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
        refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
        and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus
        is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
        presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting within the
        group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for
        example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a
        decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
        considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any resolution taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference is
        to be considered provisional until 10 working days after the
        publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent to the working
        groups mailing list. If no objections are raised on the mailing list
        within that time, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
        as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section
        3.4, Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting
        procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
