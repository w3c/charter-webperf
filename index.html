        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>As Web browsers and their underlying engines include richer
          capabilities and become more powerful, web developers are building
          more sophisticated applications where application performance is
          increasingly important. Developers need the ability to assess and
          understand the performance characteristics of their applications, and
          they need the ability to write more efficient applications, using
          well-defined interoperable methods.</p>
        <p>The Web Performance Working Group's deliverables include user agent
          features and APIs to measure and improve aspects of application
          performance. These deliverables will apply to desktop and mobile
          browsers and other non-browser environments where appropriate and will
          be consistent with Web technologies designed in other working groups
          including HTML, CSS, WebApps, DAP and SVG.</p>
        <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
        <p>In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each specification is
          expected to have two independent implementations of each of feature
          defined in
          the specification. </p>

            collect real-world performance information from the user agent while
            loading the root document of a webpage. The user agent captures the

            This
            includes the time associated with fetching the document from the

            The
            user agent captures the end to end latency associated with loading
            resources from a web server. This includes the time associated with

          <dt>Diagnostics</dt>
          <dd>An interoperable means for site developers to get web browser

          (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
            3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
          consensus and with due process. The expectation is that typically, an
          editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then
          refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
          and consensus emerges with little formal voting being
          required. However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs should put a question out for voting
          within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation --
          using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and
          record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then
          be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available. </p>
