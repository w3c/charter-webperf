      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Web developers are building sophisticated applications where application performance is a critical feature. Web developers want the ability to observe the performance characteristics of their applications, and they want the ability to write more efficient applications, using well-defined interoperable methods.
        Their methods must be both secure and privacy-enabling by design, using well-defined interoperable methods that conform to the current Web browser security model.</p>

        <p>The Web Performance Working Group's scope of work includes user agent features and APIs to observe and improve aspects of application performance, such as measuring network and rendering performance, responsiveness and interactivity, memory and CPU use, application failures, and similar APIs and infrastructure to enable measurement and delivery of better user experience. Such deliverables will apply to desktop and mobile browsers and other non-browser environments where appropriate, and will be consistent with Web technologies designed in other working groups including HTML, CSS, Web Application Security, Web Platform, Device and Sensors, and SVG.</p>

      <p>
        In addition to developing Recommendation Track documents, the Web Performance Working Group may provide review of specifications from other Working Groups.
      </p>
        <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>performance data analysis techniques or algorithms.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to  <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have at least two independent implementations of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/'>known security</a>, fingerprinting, and privacy implications, and suggested <a href='https://w3c.github.io/perf-security-privacy/'>mitigation strategies</a> for implementers, Web authors, and end users. The group should not publish a specification if acceptable mitigation strategies cannot be found.</p>
          <p>Normative specification changes are generally expected to have a corresponding set of tests, either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not required for the proposed update.</p>

Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional until 10 working days after the publication of the resolution in draft minutes sent, which will be published within 5 working days of the meeting to the working group's mailing list with a 'call for consensus' in the subject line. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.

          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
